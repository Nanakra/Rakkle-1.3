    unofficial update to 1.3 of JKV's rakkle mod
    ==Rakkle the rattle snake==

    Rakkle was a slightly human-like wild reptile that lived on a remote planet in rimworld. In the past, the rakkles found in humans were altered under genetic manipulation by them.
    The Rakkles had very slightly lower intelligence than humans, decreased aggression, and beautiful appearance by human renovation. And it's also characterized by reduced incidence of males, which is easy to breed between different species.

    Humans killed wild rakkles just in case. And they created a company called the cradle outside the galaxy and managed the rakkle. The cradle bred and brainwashed new rakkles and distributed them as slaves, pets or livestock.

    And then one day, a series of rakkle escapes from one planet after another.
    So the escaped rakkles call themselves free rakkles, and they're scattered all over the world to make up a small settlement.

    Now free rakkles are trying to get past the cradle's attack to retrieve them and move toward a bustling center where rakkle is not discriminated against.


    ==Race characteristic==

    - Shedding : The rakkle shed periodically.If a shed is imminent, you get a small bonus for your ability, but during a shedding you get a very strong debug.
            *Caution: if the rakkle does not eat 'raw meat ball', the rakkle does not shed.

    -- Advantage --
    - Fast move speed : rakkle moves faster than humans. Other species will have a hard time getting out of the rakkle chase.
    - Melee Battle Bonus: Rakkle has a higher melee combat capability than humans. They are stronger than humans when they are in gun or bare hands because they use their teeth and tails.
    - Strong tail: rakkle has no legs. Instead, it has a big tail. The tail is stronger than the human leg.
    - Long meal cycle: rakkle has a maximum calorie retention of 5. If you eat raw meat ball, which is a rakkle food, rakkle can last for about 5 days.
                            *Caution: if you don't feed the rakkle raw meat ball, the above advantages disappear.
    - High maximum adaptive temperature : rakkle can withstand hot weather.
    - Food poisoning permanent immunity

    -- Weakness --
    - Carnivore : rakkle is a carnivore. Basically, I can't eat vegetables. Cooked meals can be consumed, but there is a disadvantage to the mood.
    - Different organ locations: The heart, kidney, and liver of the rakkle are located on the upper tail. The upper tail is strong enough to protect its organs, but it can also increase its weakness.
    - Very slow cultivation: rakkle is significantly slower than humans.
    - High Food Poisoning Probability: When rakkle cooks, it is more likely to cause food poisoning than humans.
    - High minimum adaptive temperature : rakkle is very vulnerable to cold environments.
