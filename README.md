Hi Folks!

This is a fork of a fork!

The original Rakkle mod by ULCH can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2208700786

The unofficial update to 1.3 by Sunny can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2584844208

Thanks to steam user Vazrua for finding the fix for hair not showing in bed while injured and resolving the error spam.

This fork adds in that fix and makes a few other changes.

Changes in the fork:

1. Rakkle nude patch is applied. Your snek waifus have nipples when nude now.
2. The wounds that 1.3 introduced now apply properly. Thanks, Vazrua!
3. Rakkle's have the tongue part added!
4. Fangs are set as teeth and are a little harder to knock out now.
They still grow back on their birthday like before.

5. Rakkle body size increased to 2. It was 1.
Honestly, these are lamia which are larger than humans.
Why should they have the same body size?

6. Rakkle drawing scale changed to visibly show their new size.
See the Size Comparision.png for an example.
Size is compared to the following: Titan Boa, Kurin, Rakkle, Orassan.

Only changes were made for the 1.3 version of this mod.

I make no promises that any other version will work as I have not altered or tested them.

Installation instructions.

IMPORTANT!!!

Unsubscribe from the Rakkle mods on the Steam Workshop and make sure you do not have a local copy!

If you don't do this critical step, RimWorld will break, and Randy will feed your Rakkle waifus to Alpha Beavers.

1. Download and open the zip.
2. Extract the zip to your SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\ folder.
3. In the mods folder you should see a folder called Rakkle 1.3-master.
4. Activate the mod in your mod manager of choice (Use RimPy!!!) and start your game / play!

Happy playing!
